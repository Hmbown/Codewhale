/**
 * Codewhale first-party telemetry ingest.
 *
 * ============================ THE RED LINE ============================
 *
 * THIS WORKER NEVER READS, LOGS, STORES, OR FORWARDS THE CLIENT IP.
 *
 * `docs/TELEMETRY.md` publishes "Batches are IP-stripped at ingest. No IP is
 * stored, logged, or joined to `install_id`." This file is the whole of what
 * makes that sentence true. There is no other component. If you add an IP read
 * here, the published document becomes a false statement about a shipped
 * product, and every user who opted in did so on the strength of it.
 *
 * Concretely, and permanently:
 *
 *   - Do not read the connecting-address header, the proxy-chain header, or any
 *     other header that carries a network address. The names are deliberately
 *     spelled nowhere in this directory: `test/no-ip.test.ts` greps the source
 *     for them and fails the build, so an edit that adds one cannot land quietly
 *     and cannot be justified as "just for debugging".
 *   - Do not read the `cf` property of the request. Country, colo, city, region,
 *     ASN, and coordinates all live there; none of them are in the schema, and
 *     the same test greps for that access too.
 *   - Read exactly two headers, ever: `content-type` and `content-length`. The
 *     same test extracts every header name this source asks for and fails if the
 *     set grows.
 *   - Do not log the request. Structured logs in Workers are queryable, and a
 *     log line is storage. Nothing in this file logs a payload or a header.
 *   - Analytics Engine rows are built in `datapoint.ts` from the *validated
 *     batch body only*. The request object is not in scope there.
 *
 * Debugging without an IP is a solved problem: the schema carries `os`, `arch`,
 * `libc`, `surface`, `app_version`, and `git_sha`, which is what a crash triage
 * actually needs. If you find yourself wanting the IP, you want a different
 * feature, and it needs the owner's sign-off and a doc change first.
 *
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * Shape of the service: write-only. One POST route, no GET that returns data,
 * no response body on any path, ever. The client
 * (`crates/telemetry/src/client.rs`) reads only the status class and drops the
 * batch on anything that is not 2xx — no retry, no backoff, no re-queue — so a
 * rejection here is invisible to the user by construction, and a 5xx can never
 * become a client-visible error. That is what lets this endpoint fail closed:
 * when in doubt, refuse the batch.
