  lede: "As a project ages, instructions pile up and conflict: the original spec, a refactor that contradicts it, stale memory, a previous agent's handoff, your current request, fresh test output that doesn't match what the handoff claimed. A flat system prompt makes the model resolve that by guess. Codewhale uses a nested constitution with a defined rank. The harness enforces the order, tests assert it can't drift, and it stays intact when you swap models.",

  rankScope:
    "Below the three layers rank project instructions (AGENTS.md), then memory and handoffs. Your current request and live tool evidence still control the active turn — the model may be given many layers, but it is instructed never to report a fact the tools did not return.",
