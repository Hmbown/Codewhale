"""Ratchet on `#[allow(dead_code)]` so the wall can shrink but never regrow (#4785).

Why this exists rather than a one-time sweep:

    issue filed   2026-07-??   464 attributes / 143 files
    audit         2026-07-26   426 / 111
    audit         2026-07-28   481 / 155

The sweep was working and the count still went *up*, because two large landings
added state whose accessors only their own tests read. A sweep is a snapshot; a
budget is a direction. This gate makes the number a one-way door.

It deliberately does NOT judge whether any individual attribute is justified —
plenty are. It only refuses to let the total rise, which is the property the
issue actually needs and the only one that can be checked mechanically.

Note the blind spot this compensates for: CI's clippy runs without
`--all-targets`, so it never lints `cfg(test)` or integration-test code. A prior
strip-and-check measured 197 attributes alive *only* because a test references
them — exactly the ones a test-blind lint can never adjudicate.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check-dead-code-budget.py           # enforce
    python3 scripts/check-dead-code-budget.py --update  # rewrite the budget file
