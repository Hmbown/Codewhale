"""Fail when someone whose work landed in this release is not credited.

The three credit surfaces -- docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md, the CHANGELOG's Contributors
block, and web/lib/release-credits.ts -- were cross-checked only against
`requiredCandidateCredits` in docs/public-surface-facts.json, which is itself
hand-maintained. That gate proves the three files agree with each other; it
never asks whether the list is complete, so a contributor nobody remembered to
add was invisible to every check. Nine were missing from 0.10.0 when this was
written.

This derives the expected set from git history instead of from a list a human
curates: commit authors, `Co-authored-by:` trailers, and `Harvested from PR #N
by @handle` lines in the release window. Offline by design -- harvested handles
live in the commit bodies, so no network call is needed.

Usage: scripts/check-contributor-credit.py [<since-rev>]
