"""Fail when the changelog describes a bundled plugin we do not ship.

The 0.10.0 section claimed "The bundled plugin is 0.4.0" and pinned marketplace
revision `ca6be22` while the tree actually shipped 0.11.2 at revision
d8640b17f275 -- three upstream releases apart, with nothing comparing the prose
to the assets. Vendored bundles get bumped by a dependency sweep; the sentence
describing them is prose nobody re-reads.

Checks that every shipped bundled-plugin version, and the first-party
marketplace revision, literally appear in CHANGELOG.md. Cheap, offline, and it
fails on the bump rather than at release.
