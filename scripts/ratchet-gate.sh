# Run one whole-repo ratchet so a pull request is blocked by the debt it adds,
# not by the debt it inherits.
#
# Before 0.10.1 the four budget ratchets in ci.yml were advisory on every pull
# request and fatal on push. Every PR looked green, the regression surfaced only
# after merge, and main went red (38 of 154 main-push runs green, 09-16..09-22).
# This wrapper makes the ratchet block the PR and keeps exactly one escape
# hatch: when the base the PR merges into fails the same check, the failure is
# inherited debt, so it reports a warning instead of blocking the innocent PR.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ratchet-gate.sh --name NAME --update "CMD" [--base SHA] -- CHECK...
#
#   --name    label used in annotations (e.g. blocking-calls)
#   --update  the exact receipt command that lands the fix in this PR; printed
#             on failure so the author can regenerate and commit the budget
#   --base    commit to re-run the check on when it fails (the PR's merge
#             base). Defaults to $RATCHET_BASE_SHA; empty means no base
#             re-check, so the failure blocks (push, schedule, dispatch).
#   CHECK...  the checker command, run from the repository root, and again
#             from a detached checkout of --base when a base re-check runs.
#
# The base re-check needs a second checkout of an older commit. It uses a
# throwaway `git worktree` under $RUNNER_TEMP (or mktemp), removed on exit.
# That is a CI mechanism: locally, run the checker or scripts/preflight.sh.
# Cargo-backed checkers share this checkout's target directory so the base
# measurement is an incremental rebuild, not a cold one.
