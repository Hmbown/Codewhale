//! The background writer.
//!
//! One dedicated OS thread behind an unbounded `mpsc`. `record()` is a
//! non-blocking `send` and a hard no-op when the process is not armed;
//! everything the thread does is wrapped in `catch_unwind`, so a panic inside
//! telemetry costs telemetry and nothing else.
//!
//! A plain thread rather than a `tokio` task, deliberately: `init` is called
//! from six subcommand dispatch points, several of which have no runtime yet,
//! and a telemetry subsystem that only works when someone remembered to be
//! inside an executor is a subsystem that silently collects nothing on half its
//! surfaces.
