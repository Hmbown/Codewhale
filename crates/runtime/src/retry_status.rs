//! Process-wide retry-state surface (#499).
//!
//! Read-side caveat (0.9.4): the renderer this module was written for was
//! the legacy footer's retry banner, which went with `FooterWidget`. The
//! *producer* — `client::send_with_retry` — is still live and still records
//! every retry, and `client`'s own tests read it back through `snapshot`.
//! The read surface (`snapshot`, the countdown, the banner fields) is
//! therefore test-gated (`cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))` where
//! possible, so the TUI's tests reach it through the `test-support`
//! feature; `cfg_attr(not(test))` allows where prod constructs); a renderer
//! restores it by dropping the gates. Give the banner a renderer, or
//! delete the producer too — but not half of it.
//!
//! The HTTP retry path in `client::send_with_retry` already times its
//! waits and knows the error category. This module gives the TUI a way
//! to observe that state — `start`, `succeeded`, and `failed` flip a
//! global `RetryState` that the footer / status panel reads each frame.
//!
//! Why a process-wide global: the user-facing TUI runs as one engine
//! per process, and the only retry state we want to surface is the one
//! the user is staring at. Sub-agent retries in background tasks
//! deliberately do **not** light up the foreground banner — they're
//! supposed to be invisible. If a future feature ever needs per-engine
//! retry surfaces, swap this for an `Arc<RwLock<...>>` carried on the
//! `EngineHandle`; the public API stays the same.
//!
//! The `Retry-After` pause is process-wide too, but keyed by provider scope:
//! every request to the rate-limited route waits it out, and requests to any
//! other route (another provider, a local runtime) do not.
