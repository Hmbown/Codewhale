//! Keep the host from idling into sleep while a turn is in flight.
//!
//! A suspended host cannot run the engine, so nothing here survives a real
//! suspend — `core::engine::streaming::sleep_gap_detected` already reports that
//! case and the engine re-issues the request (issue #2990). What this module
//! prevents is the avoidable one: an unattended machine idling into sleep in
//! the middle of a turn, which is how a long turn gets lost with no error at
//! all.
//!
//! Scope, stated so nobody expects more than it does:
//!
//! - It holds the platform's *idle-sleep* assertion only. An explicit `sleep`/
//!   `pmset sleepnow`, a closed lid, or a low battery still wins — refusing
//!   those is the machine owner's call, not a running task's.
//! - It is held for the duration of a turn and released on drop, so the host's
//!   power behaviour outside a turn is untouched.
//! - It follows the same gate as the rest of the host-facing chrome
//!   (`EngineConfig::terminal_chrome_enabled`): an interactive TUI turn holds
//!   it, while headless hosts — `exec`, app-server, CI — never do. A dedicated
//!   `[tui]` opt-out key is not implemented yet; the headless gate is the
//!   escape hatch today.
//! - Windows is not implemented. `SetThreadExecutionState` is thread-affine —
//!   the release has to happen on the thread that set it, which a guard that
//!   travels with a turn cannot promise. Rather than ship an untested holder
//!   that might silently never release, this is a no-op there for now.
//!
//! Release is `Drop` and never cached: a leaked inhibitor would keep a laptop
//! awake forever, which is worse than the problem this solves.
//!
//! The inhibitor is a `tokio::process` child, because the guard lives inside
//! `Engine::run_turn` on the runtime: the spawn registers with the runtime,
//! `kill_on_drop` sends the release signal, and the runtime reaps the child —
//! no `wait` runs inline on a worker (#6149). `hold` therefore has to be
//! called from within a Tokio runtime context.
//!
//! `Drop` never runs when the process is killed, crashes or calls
//! `process::exit`, so each inhibitor is also tied to this process's lifetime
//! independently of the guard: on macOS `caffeinate -w <pid>` exits with the
//! process it watches, and on Linux the pipe below closes with it.
//!
//! On Linux the lock is held by `systemd-inhibit` around a child of its own,
//! and a kill is never forwarded to that grandchild. The command is therefore
//! `cat` reading a pipe this guard holds: dropping the guard closes the pipe,
//! `cat` exits on EOF, and `systemd-inhibit` follows — nothing is left behind.
