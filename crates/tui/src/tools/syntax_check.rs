//! Post-edit syntax gate for the file-mutating tools (#6204, #6206).
//!
//! Every tool that rewrites a file — `File write`/`edit`/`patch` in
//! [`super::file`] and [`super::apply_patch`], plus [`super::fim`] — routes its
//! post-edit content through [`guard_edit`] *before* the bytes reach the disk.
//! When the edit would leave a file unparseable, the write never happens and
//! the model gets a `line:column` error it can act on this turn instead of a
//! compiler failure one or more turns later.
//!
//! Rust is parsed by `syn`, which implements the real language grammar and
//! reports grammar-exact errors (as opposed to an error-tolerant CST that
//! builds a tree *around* malformed input). TOML and JSON go through
//! `toml_edit` and `serde_json` — the parsers this crate already loads its own
//! config with. A malformed `Cargo.toml` fails the *entire* workspace build
//! rather than one file, so catching it at edit time is worth more there than
//! anywhere else.
//!
//! # The gate only rejects *newly* introduced breakage
//!
//! [`guard_edit`] fails open unless the file parsed **before** the edit and
//! fails to parse **after** it. That asymmetry is the whole safety argument:
//! repairing a file that is already broken — the single most common reason an
//! agent edits a source file at all — must never be blocked by a gate whose
//! job is to catch the edit that broke it. Creating a new file is likewise
//! ungated, since there is no "before" to have regressed.
//!
//! # Known limitations
//!
//! - **Grammar, not semantics.** A file that parses can still fail to compile;
//!   type errors stay the compiler's and the LSP hook's job
//!   (`core::engine::lsp_hooks`).
//! - **`syn` tracks the editions it knows.** Source using syntax newer than the
//!   pinned `syn` would be reported as a parse error. Because the gate requires
//!   the pre-edit file to have parsed, such a file is skipped entirely rather
//!   than becoming uneditable.
//! - **Extension-driven.** A Rust file that is not named `*.rs` is not checked;
//!   language detection by content is deliberately not attempted. `.jsonc`,
//!   `.json5`, and `.jsonl` are *not* treated as JSON: they are different
//!   grammars, and a strict parser would reject valid files.
//! - **A `.json` file that is really JSONC** — `tsconfig.json` with comments is
//!   the usual one — does not parse before the edit either, so the gate skips
//!   it rather than making it uneditable.
//! - **Bounded by [`MAX_CHECKED_BYTES`].** Larger files skip the check rather
//!   than spend edit-path latency on a multi-megabyte parse.
