//! Post-edit formatting normalization for Rust files (#6205).
//!
//! Model-generated edits rarely match `rustfmt` output exactly. Once an
//! unformatted edit lands, the *next* turn's `old_string` or patch context was
//! written against text that `cargo fmt` is about to move, so anchors drift and
//! the follow-up edit fails to match. Normalizing at edit time keeps anchors
//! stable for the rest of the session, and the tool result returns the
//! normalized text, so what the model remembers writing is what is on disk.
//!
//! `rustfmt` is the formatter, not `prettyplease`: `cargo fmt --check` is this
//! repository's actual gate, and a second formatter with its own opinions would
//! produce files that pass the edit path and fail the gate. Shelling out also
//! picks up the project's own `rustfmt.toml` — an in-process pretty-printer
//! cannot.
//!
//! # Policy
//!
//! Normalization applies to the whole edited file, and **only when that file
//! was already `rustfmt`-clean before the edit**. A file whose formatting the
//! author has not handed to `rustfmt` is never rewritten. Because a clean file
//! is a formatting fixpoint, reformatting it after an edit can only change the
//! edited region — so "whole file" and "edited region" coincide, without
//! needing span arithmetic to prove it.
//!
//! # Known limitations
//!
//! - **Non-fatal, always.** A missing `rustfmt`, a parse failure, a timeout, or
//!   a non-zero exit skips normalization; the edit still lands. Nothing here
//!   can fail an edit.
//! - **Silent when skipped.** Only an applied normalization is announced. A
//!   "formatting skipped" note on every edit in a project without `rustfmt`
//!   would be noise the model cannot act on, and "skipped" is indistinguishable
//!   from "would have changed nothing" without running the formatter anyway.
//! - **Edition 2024 is assumed.** A file that `rustfmt` cannot parse under that
//!   edition fails the clean-before check and is skipped, so the assumption
//!   degrades to "no normalization", never to a mangled file.
//! - **CRLF files are skipped.** `rustfmt` emits LF; rewriting every line
//!   ending is exactly the unrelated-churn this policy exists to avoid.
