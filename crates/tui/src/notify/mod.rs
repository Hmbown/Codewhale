//! Notification policy shared by every host: the typed payload, the
//! delivery-method and category gate, attention (focus) rules, the
//! per-event sound policy and audio cues.
//!
//! Runtime code owns *what* may notify and *which* sound it selects. The
//! terminal UI owns *delivery*: `tui::notifications` is the only code that
//! writes OSC 9 / 99 / 777 escapes, the taskbar progress sequence or the
//! window title. Runtime callers that need a delivery (the `notify` tool,
//! headless exec) reach it through `crate::host_terminal`, never by
//! importing the TUI.
//!
//! Known limitation: `tui::notifications::notify_with_sinks` still combines
//! the policy below with transport selection, so the runtime API's native
//! notification preparation calls it with null sinks. Splitting transport
//! out of it is the remaining step before this module can own the whole
//! decision.
