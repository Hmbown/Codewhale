//! Workspace snapshots — pre/post-turn safety net.
//!
//! Each turn the engine takes a `pre-turn:<seq>` snapshot of the user's
//! workspace into a side git repo at
//! `<snapshot state dir>/<project_hash>/<worktree_hash>/.git`, then a
//! matching `post-turn:<seq>` snapshot when the turn finishes. Users
//! can roll back via `/restore N` (slash command) or, when the model
//! recognises an "undo my last edit" intent, the `revert_turn` tool.
//!
//! ## Why a side repo?
//!
//! - The user's own `.git` is never touched. `--git-dir` and
//!   `--work-tree` are *always* set together when we shell out to git;
//!   that single invariant is what keeps snapshots and the user's repo
//!   completely independent.
//! - Workspaces without git still get snapshots.
//! - `git`'s own deduplication (object packfiles) keeps the disk
//!   footprint tractable — typical 100 MB workspace × 12 turns ≈ 1.2 GB
//!   uncompressed but git's content-addressed storage usually brings
//!   that down 10-30×. We mitigate further with:
//!     - 7-day default retention (`session_manager` prunes at session
//!       start via [`prune::prune_older_than`]).
//!     - `gc.auto = 0` on the side repo (we don't want background gcs
//!       firing mid-turn) plus an explicit `git gc --prune=now` after
//!       prune.
//!     - Startup cleanup for stale `tmp_pack_*` files left by interrupted
//!       git pack operations.
//!
//! ## Failure model
//!
//! Pre/post-turn snapshot calls are **non-fatal**. If `git` is missing,
//! the disk is full, or the workspace is on a read-only filesystem, the
//! turn proceeds and the engine logs a warning. The snapshot is a
//! safety net, not a correctness gate.
//!
//! Workspaces over the configured size cap (`[snapshots] max_workspace_gb`,
//! default 2 GB of non-excluded content) skip snapshot init entirely. That
//! disable is intentionally loud: the operator is told once that undo is off
//! for the workspace, with the opt-in knobs (raise the cap, or set
//! `max_workspace_gb = 0` to disable the size gate). Scoped snapshot roots are
//! not yet a first-class config; the practical opt-in today is the cap override.
