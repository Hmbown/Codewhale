//! Managed (organization/fleet) plugin policy: the Runtime-side enforcement primitive.
//!
//! An organization governs its members' Runtimes by delivering a policy document
//! to each machine; this module only defines the document and enforces it.
//! Delivery (network fetch, control-plane client, MDM deployment) is out of
//! scope: the policy arrives as a local file.
//!
//! Semantics, in order of importance:
//! - **Absent policy means today's exact behaviour.** Every plugin that enables
//!   now must still enable when no policy file exists.
//! - **Local state can never defeat the policy.** Enforcement lives in the
//!   registry's `apply_state` choke point, so a plugin enabled before the
//!   policy arrived, or an `enabled: true` bit hand-edited into `state.json`,
//!   comes back disabled — there is no window in which a forbidden plugin is
//!   active. `PluginRegistry::enable` re-reads the document so a policy that
//!   lands after discovery still refuses.
//! - **A malformed policy fails closed.** An unreadable, unparseable, or
//!   wrong-schema document refuses every enablement with a clear error; it
//!   never silently degrades to "allow everything".
//!
//! The document is resolved to a single source: `managed-policy.json` next to
//! the plugin `state.json`, overridable by `CODEWHALE_MANAGED_POLICY_PATH` for
//! testing. The override is read from the pre-dotenv [`HostEnvironment`]
//! snapshot so a workspace dotenv file cannot redirect organization governance.
//!
//! This is deliberately a different concept from
//! [`PluginActivationPolicy`](super::activation::PluginActivationPolicy), which
//! describes which capability *kinds* this build will ever activate. The managed
//! policy describes which plugin *identities* this machine may enable.
//!
//! # Known limitations
//!
//! The "no window in which a forbidden plugin is active" guarantee above is
//! scoped to *in-process activation*: every live capability surface (MCP
//! servers, Skills, agents, hooks, commands) reaches the plugin through
//! [`LoadedPlugin::active`](super::types::LoadedPlugin::active), which reads
//! the `enabled` bit that `apply_state` has already gated. This policy is
//! **not** consulted by
//! [`verify_plugin_state_authority`](super::registry::verify_plugin_state_authority),
//! the execution-boundary revocation probe, which re-reads the persisted
//! `state.json` `enabled` bit directly and never sees the in-memory registry.
//! A [`PluginAuthority`](super::types::PluginAuthority) minted before the
//! policy arrived and then *persisted* — today only the offline-queue
//! `skill_provenance` receipt, which survives a restart — therefore
//! revalidates against `state.json` alone. Closing that path means enforcing
//! the policy at the authority boundary too, which this slice does not do.
