//! Turn artifact routes (#6653): what a runtime turn produced.
//!
//! The authority is the runtime store's turn record and its items. Nothing
//! is scanned: every reference was recorded where its bytes were written,
//! and the workspace delta comes from the engine's own snapshot pair. Reads
//! go through the same confined openers as the workspace file and session
//! artifact routes; there is no second store.
