/// - `Routine` - provably read-only; minimal chrome.
/// - `Elevated` - ordinary state-touching work (edits, builds, MCP
///   actions); a calm approval, not a warning.
/// - `Critical` - genuinely destructive, publish-like, or
///   secret-touching per `ToolActionKind`; keeps the strong styling and
