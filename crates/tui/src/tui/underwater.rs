//! Coherent shell grammar for the underwater TUI.
//!
//! This module owns phase, responsive density, the empty-state composition,
//! and the compact header/footer fact budget. Product data still belongs to
//! [`App`]; this is only its terminal projection. Keeping these decisions in
//! one place prevents the default UI from drifting back into a header +
//! sidebar + dashboard + footer composition with four owners for one fact.
