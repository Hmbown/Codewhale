//! Workspace drive lease: at most one driving engine per workspace, process-wide.
//!
//! The store process-owner lock serializes writers of one *store*, but a
//! workspace is shared across stores — a per-workspace store (the VS Code
//! extension), a per-session store (the interactive TUI) and the user-level
//! default store can all point at the same working tree, the same snapshot
//! side-repo (keyed by canonical workspace path) and the same git index, with
//! nothing serializing them across processes. The lease lifts the exclusivity
//! unit to the workspace itself.
//!
//! Drive vs watch: only a *driving* engine takes the lease. Watch-only
//! observers never do — their token intent already forbids mutation, and they
//! attach to the owner that holds the lease rather than admitting their own
//! workspace scope.
//!
//! The mechanism mirrors the store process-owner lock: an fd lock the kernel
//! releases when the holder dies, plus a small holder record a contender can
//! read to name the holder in a legible refusal, plus a kernel-backed liveness
//! check so a provably-dead holder's residue can be broken instead of refusing
//! every later start.
